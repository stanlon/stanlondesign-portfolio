        <h1>Hookah Bar Documentation</h1>
        <section>
          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>To create an online presence that will bring in more customers to the hookah lounge. By having a website online, potential customers will be able to see hours of operation, the location of the hookah lounge, upcoming events, prices, different flavors of hookah and snacks and drinks that are served. Most importantly the business will now have a website with all of the hookah lounge’s information that is accessible across all desktop, tablet and mobile devices in one place. To gain more customers the hookah lounge is aiming at creating special events that they will host around major holidays which will be a primary page of the website that they want to update at any time with information or images.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>To build an online presence for the hookah lounge and its customers.</li>
            <li>Have an events page that can be updated any time with special events the hookah lounge will be hosting.</li>
            <li>From their social media page(s), have a link that will directly send customers to their official website that will fit any desktop, tablet or mobile device.</li>
            <li>To showcase all of the services the hookah lounge offers such as flavors of hookah, types of hookah, food, drinks and snacks in a professional and organized manner.</li>
            <li>Drive sales and bring in new customers through Google analytics, SEO and ad tracking.</li>
            <li>To have a domain name that matches the name of the hookah lounge so that it’s easy to find and locate on the internet.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Target Audience</h2>
          <p>Target audience that this website is aiming for is groups of friends ranging in age from 18 years old to 30 years old. Although hookah can be smoked alone, the more people that come in together, the more they will enjoy the experience and are more likely to spread the word through their chain of friends. Also aiming for couples in that same age range that are looking to go out and enjoy a relaxing and peaceful night smoking hookah compared to a night out that’s more hyped up and intense.</p>
          <p>During special events, discounts will be offered in the hopes of bringing in new comers to try hookah if they never have before. There will also be happy hours Monday through Friday where hookah will be discounted to help build a community of regulars.</p>
