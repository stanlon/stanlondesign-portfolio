          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>To build a website that attracts more customers to their business by giving this barbershop an online presence that is both aesthetically pleasing as well as an easy user experience. By having a website this will give the audience easy access to their content across all browsers even through mobile and tablet devices on the go. This website will display brand new content of new designs, haircuts and beard trims. Before the customer physically arrives to the barbershop, assuming the customer has looked at this website beforehand, they will have a clear idea of services, prices, and a picture of the staff members and which barber could possibly be giving them a haircut when they stop by or set up an appointment on the phone.</p>

            <li>Easy to navigate and simple to use from the moment the customer lands on the home page of the website. So simple to understand that it’s self-explaining from user interaction.</li>

          <h2>Detailed Pages, Features and Sections</h2>
          <p><b>Navigation: </b>Will be at the top of every page on the website that will include both the barber shops logo and name. Also, an easy to use and self-understanding navigation menu to explore the site.</p>
          <p><b>Footer: </b>Will be at the bottom of every page on the website. It will include the hours of operation of the barber shop, an address with a button to google maps that will clearly provide directions to the barber shop and contact information including a phone number and an email address so the customer can get ahold of the barber shop staff.</p>
          <p><b>Landing Page: </b>First thing the customer will see is a slide show of barber shop images detailing what this barber shop has to offer. There will be a three column layout of a few things that the customer can quickly see and click on to get more information about including service, gallery and contact information.</p>
          <p><b>Services: </b>An image of one of the barbers providing one of the services that is offered at the barber shop. The content on the page will be laid out in a two-column layout. The main content will take up 70% of the expanded width and display the services offered, the price and the estimated amount of time the service may take. The second column to the left will expand 30% in width and be displayed as a side bar. The side bar will have information about three different types of content with a button that will link to that part of the website. Those will be haircut styles, meeting the team/staff members and seeing the gallery of work previously done at the barber shop.</p>
          <p><b>Careers: </b>An image with a title and tagline promoting potential barbers to apply if they know how to cut hair and have experience as a barber. Below that will be a submission form asking for the potential barber for their first and last name, phone number, email, address, date of birth, desired position, pay, availability, hours they can work, whether they attended a barber school, how many years of experience they have, their previous employer, whether we’re able to contact their previous employer and a survey question asking how they found out about the position they’re applying for.</p>
          <p><b>About: </b>A letter from the owner explaining the business, when they opened, how long they’ve been at that location and why his/her barber shop is the next place to make your new barber shop home. Below will be a picture of each barber that is currently working there. After that will be a gallery of all of the work they’ve done including haircuts, beard cuts/trims, designs, pictures of the business, etc.</p>
          <p><b>Contact: </b>Will be a google map showing exactly where the barber shop is located with a pin point address. Below the google map will be a submission form for customers to fill out and send the barber shop if they have any questions or concerns. The customer will be required to fill out their first and last name, their phone number, an email address they can be reached at and a message that they would like to send.</p>
