      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p><span>W</span>elcome to Stanlon Design! My name is Stanlon and this is my web portfolio. I am a front-end web developer located in Denver, Colorado. I graduated from Metropolitan State University of Denver in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Technical Communications and an emphasis in Interactive Media. My passion is building custom made responsive websites. My skills are in HTML5, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and WordPress.  </p>
      <p><span>O</span>n my free time, I like learning new web development skills by watching <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/stanlon" target="_blank">TeamTreeHouse</a> tutorials. Other than coding, I like to design and create svg illustrations and animations. My hobbies also include photography, watching movies, hanging out with friends and working out at the local rec center. </p>
